# Exclude the .gitignore file itself from being ignored
!.gitignore

# Explicitly re-include the specific directories you want to track
# The trailing slash is crucial here to specify directories.
!fish/
!nvim/
!ghostty/
!ghostty/*
!tmux/

# This rule will ignore any file with a .bak extension, even inside the
# directories you are tracking.
